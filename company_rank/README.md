This script should be used specifically on the Haas server to build ranking of companies based on yearly transitions of employees between companies. The script first build the yearly transition graph and then run page rank algorithm on the graph and output the result in csv file to the desired output path. Please make sure the neo4j is probably set up (according to the comment in the script) before running.
